Build impressive and eye-catching sections with parallax effects, shape dividers, and many more tweaks using this versatile Gutenberg block.


== Description ==

**TZM Section Block** brings powerful enhancements to the Gutenberg editor, allowing you to create visually appealing sections for your website with ease. This block is based on the official "Cover block" but offers advanced features for greater flexibility and design options.

* **Enhanced Parallax Background**: Choose from "slow," "medium," and "fast" parallax speeds for a dynamic visual effect beyond the traditional "fixed" option.
* **Customizable Divider Shapes**: Add top and bottom divider shapes to your sections. Choose from various shapes and customize their color, height, and more.
* **Responsive Full-Height Sections**: Adjust full-height sections (100vh) to fit perfectly on screens by subtracting the height of a CSS selector element, such as a fixed header.
* **Overflow Content Control**: Easily hide or display overflowing content within a section.

With these advanced options, TZM Section Block empowers designers and developers to craft sections that stand out while providing intuitive controls for seamless customization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes this block different from the default Cover block? =
TZM Section Block extends the capabilities of the Cover block with more advanced parallax options, divider shapes, and the ability to precisely control full-height sections and overflow content.

= Can I use this block with any theme? =
Yes, the plugin is designed to work with any WordPress theme that supports the block editor. For the best experience, use a theme with flexible layout options.

= How does the "CSS selector adjustment" feature work? =
When the full-height (100vh) option is enabled, you can specify a CSS selector (e.g., `.header`) whose height will be subtracted from the block's height. This ensures the section fits perfectly on the screen without being obstructed by fixed elements like headers.

= Are the divider shapes responsive? =
Yes, the divider shapes are fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

= Can I customize the styles of this block further? =
Absolutely! The plugin provides plenty of built-in options, but if you need more control, you can use custom CSS for additional styling.
